# nkn-client-go

Go implementation of NKN client.

Send and receive data between any NKN clients without setting up a server.

Note: This is a **client** version of the NKN protocol, which can send and
receive data but **not** relay data (mining). For **node** implementation which
can mine NKN token by relaying data, please refer to
[nkn](https://github.com/nknorg/nkn/).

**Note: This repository is in the early development stage and may not have all
functions working properly. It should be used only for testing now.**

## Usage

Create a client with a generated key pair:

```go
account, _ := vault.NewAccount()
client, _ := NewClient(account, "")
```

Or with an identifier (used to distinguish different clients sharing the same
key pair):

```go
client, _ := NewClient(account, "any string")
```

Get client key pair:

```go
fmt.PrintLn(account.PrivateKey, account.PublicKey)
```

Create a client using an existing private key:

```go
privateKey, _ := common.HexStringToBytes("cd5fa29ed5b0e951f3d1bce5997458706186320f1dd89156a73d54ed752a7f37")
account, _ := vault.NewAccountWithPrivatekey(privateKey)
client, _ := NewClient(account, "any string")
```

By default the client will use bootstrap RPC server (for getting node address)
provided by us. Any NKN full node can serve as a bootstrap RPC server. To create
a client using customized bootstrap RPC server:

```go
SeedRPCServerAddr = "https://ip:port"
client, _ := NewClient(account, "any string")
```

Private key should be kept **SECRET**! Never put it in version control system
like here.

Get client NKN address, which is used to receive data from other clients:

```go
fmt.Println(client.Address)
```

Listen for connection established:

```go
<- client.OnConnect
fmt.Println("Connection opened.")
```

Send byte array to other clients:

```go
client.Send([]string{"another client address"}, []byte{1, 2, 3, 4, 5}, 0)
```

Receive data from other clients:

```go
msg := <- client.OnMessage
fmt.Println("Receive binary message from", msg.Src + ":", string(msg.Payload))
```
